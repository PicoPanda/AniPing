This file contains the CLI commands that are used to interact with the application.
We use the module `click` to create the CLI commands. The `click` module is a Python package that provides a simple way to create command line interfaces.

The `click` module provides a decorator `@click.command()` that can be used to define a CLI command. The `@click.command()` decorator takes a few arguments to define the command, such as the name of the command, the help text, and the options that the command accepts.
The `@click.command()` decorator can be used to define a function as a CLI command. The function should take the necessary arguments and options as parameters.
